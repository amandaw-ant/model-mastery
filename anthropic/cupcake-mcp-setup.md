# Deploying the Cupcake MCP server to Azure

Reusable runbook for standing up the Cupcake Store MCP server for a workshop.

Source: [GlobalAICommunity/cupcake-mcp](https://github.com/GlobalAICommunity/cupcake-mcp) — Henk Boelman, MIT.
FastAPI + Azure Table Storage, MCP mounted at `/mcp/`.

**This is not a Foundry resource.** It's a plain Container App. The Foundry
project only ever sees it as a URL in `CUPCAKE_MCP_URL`.

Budget 20-30 minutes; most of that is provisioning and build time.

The commands here are written for bash, so they run as they are on a Mac, on
Linux, and in a Codespace. On Windows, run them in a Codespace.

---

## Stage 0 — Prerequisites

Azure CLI, Git, and a subscription you can create resources in.

```
az login
az account show --output table
az account set --subscription "<subscription name or id>"   # if the wrong one
az extension add --name containerapp --upgrade
```

Register the resource providers. **Do this before anything else** — each one
fails the relevant create step if missing, and registration takes a few minutes:

```
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Storage
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerRegistry
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.App
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights
```

Check progress with `az provider show -n Microsoft.Storage --query registrationState -o tsv`
(want `Registered`).

---

## Stage 1 — Pick names

| Thing | Rule | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Region | Near the attendees. Any region with Container Apps works for this server | `uksouth` / `japaneast` |
| Resource group | Any | `rg-cupcake-mcp` |
| ACR | **Globally unique, alphanumeric only, no hyphens** | `crcupcake01` |
| Storage account | **Globally unique, lowercase alphanumeric, 3–24 chars** | `stcupcake01` |
| Container Apps env | Any | `cae-cupcake-mcp` |
| Container app | Any | `ca-cupcake-mcp` |

Name conflicts on the two globally-unique ones are the usual snag — add digits.

The commands below use `uksouth`. If you picked another region, change it in
Stages 3, 4 and 6. It does not have to match the region of the Search service
or the Foundry project: the agent reaches each one by its own address.

---

## Stage 2 — Get the code

```
git clone https://github.com/GlobalAICommunity/cupcake-mcp
cd cupcake-mcp
```

Build context only. Nothing runs locally; Azure does the build.

---

## Stage 3 — Resource group

```
az group create -n rg-cupcake-mcp -l uksouth
```

---

## Stage 4 — Storage account

```
az storage account create \
  -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n stcupcake01 \
  -l uksouth --sku Standard_LRS --kind StorageV2
```

Get the connection string, needed in Stage 7:

```
az storage account show-connection-string \
  -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n stcupcake01 --query connectionString -o tsv
```

**Holds all store config** — flavours, prices, stock, orders, admin password.
Keep it even if the app is torn down.

---

## Stage 5 — Registry and image build

```
az acr create -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n crcupcake01 --sku Basic --admin-enabled true
az acr build -r crcupcake01 -t cupcake-mcp:latest .
```

Run the build from inside `cupcake-mcp/`. Builds in Azure, no local Docker.
Wait for `Run ID ... succeeded`.

---

## Stage 6 — Container Apps environment

```
az containerapp env create \
  -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n cae-cupcake-mcp \
  -l uksouth --logs-destination none
```

This one takes the longest.

---

## Stage 7 — The app

Set the three secrets as shell variables first. Same terminal window as the
next command — they don't survive a new shell.

```
STORAGE_CONN=$(az storage account show-connection-string \
  -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n stcupcake01 --query connectionString -o tsv)

SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

ACR_PASSWORD=$(az acr credential show -n crcupcake01 \
  --query "passwords[0].value" -o tsv)
```

`SESSION_SECRET` is invented, not looked up — any random string. You never use
it again. Check all three are populated before continuing:

```
echo "storage: ${#STORAGE_CONN}  session: ${#SESSION_SECRET}  acr: ${#ACR_PASSWORD}"
```

Roughly 180 / 44 / 50. A zero means that command returned nothing and the
create below will fail unhelpfully.

Then paste this as-is — no placeholders to fill:

```
az containerapp create \
  -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n ca-cupcake-mcp \
  --environment cae-cupcake-mcp \
  --image crcupcake01.azurecr.io/cupcake-mcp:latest \
  --registry-server crcupcake01.azurecr.io \
  --registry-username crcupcake01 \
  --registry-password "$ACR_PASSWORD" \
  --target-port 8000 --ingress external \
  --min-replicas 1 --max-replicas 1 \
  --secrets storage-conn="$STORAGE_CONN" session-secret="$SESSION_SECRET" \
  --env-vars AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=secretref:storage-conn \
             SESSION_SECRET=secretref:session-secret \
             SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true
```

`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` is required on HTTPS or the admin login cookie
won't stick.

**`--min-replicas 1 --max-replicas 1` is required for a workshop.** The server
keeps each agent's MCP session in memory, in one process. Without the pin,
Container Apps uses its defaults, 0 to 10 replicas, and both ends break
sessions:

- **Scale to zero when idle.** The next request starts a fresh replica and
  every existing session is gone.
- **Scale out under load.** A full room can start a second replica, and a
  request routed there does not know the session.

Attendees see `session was terminated` from the agent, part-way through a lab.

**Already deployed without it?** Pin it before the event:

```
az containerapp update -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n ca-cupcake-mcp \
  --min-replicas 1 --max-replicas 1
```

One replica is enough for a room of 30 making light JSON calls. It costs a
little more while it runs, so turn the app off afterwards (Stage 11).

---

## Stage 8 — URL and smoke test

```
az containerapp show -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n ca-cupcake-mcp \
  --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn -o tsv
```

| URL | What |
|---|---|
| `https://<fqdn>/dashboard` | Order queue + rotating voucher (project this) |
| `https://<fqdn>/admin` | Admin portal |
| `https://<fqdn>/mcp/` | Agent endpoint — **trailing slash required** |

Open `/dashboard` first. If it loads, app and storage are both healthy. Tables
are created and `admin`/`admin` seeded on first start.

---

## Stage 9 — Configure the store

Log in at `/admin` (`admin`/`admin`).

1. **Users → change the admin password.** First.
2. **Flavours → add every flavour** on the catering photo and in the Module 1.6 prompt.
3. **Every price to 4.00.**
4. **Hazelnut at stock 0** — zero-stock flavours are hidden from the agent, which is what makes it "sold out".
5. Any non-zero stock for the rest.

Skipping 3 or 4 makes Module 1.6 fail in a way that looks like a model problem.

---

## Stage 10 — Wire into the lab

In the workshop repo's root `.env`:

```
CUPCAKE_MCP_URL="https://<fqdn>/mcp/"
```

---

## Checking it's up

Quickest is to hit the endpoints:

```
FQDN=$(az containerapp show -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n ca-cupcake-mcp \
  --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn -o tsv)

for p in /dashboard /cupcakes /mcp/; do
  printf "%-12s %s\n" "$p" "$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' --max-time 15 https://$FQDN$p)"
done
```

| Path | Healthy | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `/dashboard` | `200` | App and storage both working |
| `/cupcakes` | `200` | API serving |
| `/mcp/` | **`406`** | Correct. Streamable HTTP needs specific `Accept` headers, so a plain GET is "Not Acceptable". A `404` here is the bad sign. |

Azure's own view:

```
az containerapp show -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n ca-cupcake-mcp \
  --query "{running:properties.runningStatus, provisioning:properties.provisioningState}" -o table

az containerapp revision list -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n ca-cupcake-mcp \
  --query "[].{name:name, active:properties.active, replicas:properties.replicas, health:properties.healthState}" -o table
```

Want `Running` / `Succeeded`, and a revision that is `Active` and `Healthy`.

Want `replicas: 1`. `replicas: 0` with an `Active`, `Healthy` revision means
the app was created without the pin in Stage 7. It is not down, and the next
request will start it, but starting it drops every live MCP session. Pin it
before the event. Deactivated is the real off state (see below).

### "Session was terminated" during a lab

The attendee runs `agent.py` again. A new session starts on the next call and
nothing is lost: orders and customer IDs are in Table Storage. Then check the
replica count above. If it is not 1, pin it.

**Check the server is actually down before you restart it.** Most "cannot
reach it" reports are a company network or VPN blocking
`*.azurecontainerapps.io`. Run the endpoint check above from a phone on mobile
data: that separates "the server is down" from "our network blocks it" in ten
seconds.

To restart it:

```
az containerapp revision restart -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n ca-cupcake-mcp \
  --revision $(az containerapp revision list -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n ca-cupcake-mcp \
               --query "[0].name" -o tsv)
```

A restart loses no store data. Flavours, stock, orders, customers and the
admin password are all in the storage account. It does drop every live
session, and the voucher code starts again.

## Stage 11 — Security and shutting down

The MCP endpoint has no authentication by design. Don't leave it up between
events.

### What's exposed

| Surface | Risk |
|---|---|
| `list_cupcakes`, `/cupcakes`, `/dashboard` | Read-only, nothing sensitive |
| `register_customer` | Junk records — nuisance |
| `order_cupcake` | Voucher-gated, one per customer, stock-limited, throttled |
| `/docs` | Swagger UI, advertises the whole API |
| `/admin` | bcrypt + signed cookies |

Blast radius is small: no real data, and the storage connection string is a
Container App secret scoped to one storage account. Nothing reaches the
Foundry project. The realistic downside is **nuisance and some cost** — pinned
to one replica the bill has a ceiling, but a hammered endpoint still slows the
room down and pollutes the dashboard you're demoing on.

### Lock to your own IP while testing

Solo dry run? Allowlist yourself. No code change, no fork.

```
MY_IP=$(curl -s ifconfig.me)

az containerapp ingress access-restriction set \
  -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n ca-cupcake-mcp \
  --rule-name allow-me --ip-address $MY_IP/32 --action Allow
```

One Allow rule means everything else is denied. Your IP changes with a network
or VPN switch — re-run it then. **Remove the rule before the workshop:**

```
az containerapp ingress access-restriction remove \
  -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n ca-cupcake-mcp --rule-name allow-me
```

### Turning it off

Store config lives in Table Storage, so the app is disposable.

**Use revision deactivate.** There is no `az containerapp stop` (checked on CLI
2.86.0). Deactivating the revision stops the replicas without touching ingress
config, so **the FQDN is preserved** — verified 2026-09-13: 404 while
deactivated, 200 on the same URL after activating.

```
REV=$(az containerapp revision list -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n ca-cupcake-mcp \
  --query "[0].name" -o tsv)

az containerapp revision deactivate -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n ca-cupcake-mcp --revision $REV   # off
az containerapp revision activate   -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n ca-cupcake-mcp --revision $REV   # on
```

Allow ~30s after activating before it serves again.

Heavier options:

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `az containerapp ingress disable -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n ca-cupcake-mcp` | Unreachable. Throws away ingress config — `enable` needs `--type external --target-port 8000` restated. Not tested; no reason to use it over revision deactivate. |
| `az containerapp delete -g rg-cupcake-mcp -n ca-cupcake-mcp` | Gone; recreate with Stage 7 |
| `az group delete -n rg-cupcake-mcp` | Everything, including store config |

Between sessions: **Clear All Orders** in the admin portal — wipes orders,
leaves stock.

### Suggested rhythm

IP-restrict while testing → deactivate the revision overnight → delete the app
when the dry run is done, keeping the storage account so the next region starts
with the flavours already configured.

---

## Running in two regions

Environments and storage accounts can't be moved between regions — deploy a
second stack instead, it's just Stages 3–7 with different names.

- **Separate storage account per region.** Sharing one sends every Table
  Storage call across continents.
- **The FQDN differs**, so `CUPCAKE_MCP_URL` changes — including in the
  Skillable image if attendee `.env` files come from there.
- **Reconfigure the store** in the new region (Stage 9, ~10 min).

Latency matters because every tool call is a round trip from the attendee's
laptop, and the dashboard refreshes every 5s on the projector. Model calls go
to Foundry, not here — if the Foundry project is far away, that dominates.

---

## Gotchas

- `Microsoft.Storage` not registered → storage create fails. Stage 0.
- ACR name with hyphens → rejected. Alphanumeric only.
- `/mcp` without trailing slash → doesn't resolve. `main.py` mounts at `/mcp`
  over `http_app(path="/")`, so the trailing slash is required even though the
  source repo's URL table shows `/mcp`.
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false` on HTTPS → admin login appears to succeed then
  bounces back to the login page.
- No `--min-replicas 1 --max-replicas 1` → `session was terminated` part-way
  through a lab. Stage 7.
- "You have already had your one real cupcake" → not a fault. It is the limit
  of one order per customer. A new customer ID clears it.
